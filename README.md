# Analysis-and-Predict-Student-Performance
Knowing a student's social, gender, and academic information is a crucial tool for figuring out what kind of grades they are getting. In this project, I will use data on secondary school student performance to analyze them and predict the students' final grades. The dataset is based on a study conducted by Cortez and Silva (2008).

Data Set Information:
The secondary education student achievement of two Portuguese schools is examined in this data set. The information was gathered through the use of surveys and school reports, and its properties include student grades as well as demographic, social, and school-related information. Regarding performance in two different subjects—mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por)—two datasets are offered. The two datasets were modeled for binary/five-level classification and regression tasks in [Cortez and Silva, 2008].
